SETUP
- is not required. You can view it http://cpsc304.robmaceachern.com.
This project will require a bit of setup to run on a personal machine (but this is not required to see the project in action)
	1. Tomcat web server must be downloaded and linked to the project.
	2. The CrazyCoolLibrary project contains the files to create the database (library.sql) and seed (seed.sql) it with some initial data in the package 'ca.ubc.cpsc304.r3'.
	   These files have been built with MySQL syntax and so must be used with a MySQL server.
	   Database access is granted to username/password: devuser/devuser.
	3. Must compile java project and start Tomcat server to be able to access site on browser.
	
It is easiest to embed the Tomcat server in Eclipse, build the path to the MySQL driver jar, then run the project on the set up server.
